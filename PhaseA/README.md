# Image-Enhancement-with-Super-Resolution-and-Controlled-Noise
This paper explores signal reconstruction using machine learning, with a specific focus on image enhancement tasks. The first approach uses a single model for various image reconstruction tasks, including denoising and denoising synthetic images, all based only on corrupted data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of learning recovery without explicit image or corruption models. The second approach addresses image super-resolution (SR), a challenging task due to its inherent ambiguity. Previous deep learning methods struggle with non-stationary degradations, limiting their effectiveness in some applications. To deal with this, we propose a basic U-net and a robust (RU-net) architecture that learns the relationship between degraded low-resolution images and high-resolution images. The main idea of the project is to test the most efficient approach for image enhancement tasks.
